# Dodge Me!! (PC Game)
This game is developed in Java using Swing Components such as JFrame and MySql database at it's backend. The theme of the game is that a protagonist should dodge the square shaped objects [obstacles] which would be moving in a random fashion and if it hits the protogonist the life of the protogonist would be reduced. There would be some healiing aids given to the protogonist if the health goes in the critical state. The user can select his background color for the game by changing the values of three scrollbars namely (Red, Blue and Green) and even the level can be selected in Select level tab. The high score for the game is decided by the amount of time the user (protogonist) is alive. When the game is over the user will be prompted a widow which would ask for his/her name along with the score what he achieved and that value will be stored in the database and can be viewed by the user by clicking the highscore button in the Main menu. There will be a button which would show the instructions for the game.
